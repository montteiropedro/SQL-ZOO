# SQL-ZOO (The Odin Project)

SQL ZOO exercises can be found [here](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

That was an interesting journey as I had never used SQL before this lessons. I really learned a lot here, but I know it's not enough.
So, from now on I'm going for the [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/montteiropedro)'s SQL exercises, I'm looking forward to get better at it.
